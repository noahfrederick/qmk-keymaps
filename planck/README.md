# My Planck Keyboard Layout

The Planck is a 40% computer keyboard with an [ortholinear][olkb] layout
(the keys are arranged in columns rather than being staggered as on a traditional typewriter keyboard).
The keys are laid out in a 4 by 12 grid, sometimes with a 2-unit wide spacebar on the bottom row (the so-called MIT layout), for a total of 48 or 47 keys.

The board's microcontroller is programmed through the free/libre [QMK firmware][qmk],
which allows for a great deal of flexibility in implementing keyboard layouts.
The keymap is organized into layers that can be switched between by holding or tapping function keys.
